Although there are various advantages and disadvantages to moving to AWS EC2 instances, a key benefit is cost reduction, particularly if on-premises servers are only used during patching and standby periods. By scaling instances as needed, moving to AWS can significantly reduce costs compared to maintaining on-premises Windows machines.

However, there are also challenges to consider, such as the need to submit request forms for opening firewall rules, which can be a time-consuming process. Additionally, transitioning from on-premises to AWS may affect E2E dashboards, but this should not be an issue until Ansible Tower has been migrated to the cloud.

Given these factors, it may be advisable to conduct a proof of concept (PoC) before fully transitioning to AWS EC2 instances. Therefore, proceeding with on-premises solutions for the time being could be a prudent course of action.
